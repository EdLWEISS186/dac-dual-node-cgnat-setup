## 5. Status & Response-Class Glossary

| Status / Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| HEALTHY | The endpoint or overall infrastructure state is reachable and behaving as expected. |
| DEGRADED | The endpoint is reachable, but one or more checks or response-time indicators show reduced quality. |
| PARTIAL_OUTAGE | At least one monitored endpoint is unavailable or failing while other endpoints remain reachable. |
| UNHEALTHY | The endpoint failed required checks or did not provide usable responses. |
| FAST | The observed response-time class is fast for this watcher context. |
| MODERATE | The observed response-time class is acceptable but not fast. |
| SLOW | The observed response-time class is slow and may indicate degraded user experience. |
| UNKNOWN | The watcher could not classify the response-time state, often because older snapshots did not include this field. |
| N/A | Not available or not applicable for the selected observation, endpoint, or historical snapshot. |

## 6. Interpretation Guide

- Availability status describes whether a service is reachable and usable.
- Response class describes response-time behavior, not availability.
- Older snapshots may show UNKNOWN or null response class because response-time classification was added after the initial watcher release.
- This custom range report is independent observation material and not an official DAC service status page.
