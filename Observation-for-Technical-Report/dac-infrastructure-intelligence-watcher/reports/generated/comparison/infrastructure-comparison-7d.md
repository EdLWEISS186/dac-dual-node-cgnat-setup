## 2. Endpoint Availability and Response Comparison

| Endpoint | Window A status counts | Window B status counts | Window A avg response | Window B avg response | Direction |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| official_public_rpc | DEGRADED: 5, HEALTHY: 5 | DEGRADED: 3, HEALTHY: 5, UNHEALTHY: 2 | 3047.4 ms | 1811.2 ms | IMPROVED |
| explorer_web | HEALTHY: 10 | HEALTHY: 10 | 577.4 ms | 711.7 ms | WORSENED |
| primary_explorer_api | HEALTHY: 10 | HEALTHY: 10 | 392.9 ms | 535.3 ms | WORSENED |

## 3. Response Class Comparison

| Endpoint | Window A response classes | Window B response classes | Window A max response | Window B max response |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| official_public_rpc | SLOW: 10 | FAST: 2, MODERATE: 1, SLOW: 7 | 15336.0 ms | 4632.0 ms |
| explorer_web | FAST: 4, MODERATE: 6 | FAST: 1, MODERATE: 9 | 841.0 ms | 1246.0 ms |
| primary_explorer_api | FAST: 8, MODERATE: 2 | FAST: 5, MODERATE: 5 | 544.0 ms | 1157.0 ms |

## 4. Interpretation

- Overall availability score changed from 0.775 to 0.705: WORSENED.
- Official Public RPC average response changed from 3047.4 ms to 1811.2 ms: IMPROVED.
- Explorer Web average response changed from 577.4 ms to 711.7 ms: WORSENED.
- Primary Explorer API average response changed from 392.9 ms to 535.3 ms: WORSENED.
- The later observation window shows weaker overall infrastructure availability.

## 6. Status & Response-Class Glossary

| Status / Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| HEALTHY | The endpoint or overall infrastructure state is reachable and behaving as expected. |
| DEGRADED | The endpoint is reachable, but one or more checks or response-time indicators show reduced quality. |
| PARTIAL_OUTAGE | At least one monitored endpoint is unavailable or failing while other endpoints remain reachable. |
| UNHEALTHY | The endpoint failed required checks or did not provide usable responses. |
| FAST | The observed response-time class is fast for this watcher context. |
| MODERATE | The observed response-time class is acceptable but not fast. |
| SLOW | The observed response-time class is slow and may indicate degraded user experience. |
| UNKNOWN | The watcher could not classify the response-time state, often because older snapshots did not include this field. |
| N/A | Not available or not applicable for the selected observation, endpoint, or historical snapshot. |

## 7. Interpretation Guide

- Window A represents the earlier observation segment.
- Window B represents the later observation segment.
- For availability score, higher is better.
- For response time, lower is better.
- Older snapshots may show N/A or UNKNOWN response classes because response-time classification was added after the initial watcher release.
- This comparison report is independent observation material and not an official DAC service status page.
