## 2. Endpoint Availability and Response Comparison

| Endpoint | Window A status counts | Window B status counts | Window A avg response | Window B avg response | Direction |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| official_public_rpc | DEGRADED: 14, HEALTHY: 16, UNHEALTHY: 3 | DEGRADED: 15, HEALTHY: 15, UNHEALTHY: 3 | 3269.45 ms | 10682.7 ms | WORSENED |
| explorer_web | HEALTHY: 33 | HEALTHY: 33 | 601.09 ms | 634.97 ms | WORSENED |
| primary_explorer_api | HEALTHY: 33 | HEALTHY: 33 | 447.39 ms | 477.39 ms | WORSENED |

## 3. Response Class Comparison

| Endpoint | Window A response classes | Window B response classes | Window A max response | Window B max response |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| official_public_rpc | FAST: 3, MODERATE: 5, SLOW: 25 | SLOW: 33 | 20946.0 ms | 27901.0 ms |
| explorer_web | FAST: 12, MODERATE: 21 | FAST: 5, MODERATE: 28 | 1246.0 ms | 1016.0 ms |
| primary_explorer_api | FAST: 22, MODERATE: 11 | FAST: 15, MODERATE: 18 | 1157.0 ms | 942.0 ms |

## 4. Interpretation

- Overall availability score changed from 0.7364 to 0.7227: WORSENED.
- Official Public RPC average response changed from 3269.45 ms to 10682.7 ms: WORSENED.
- Explorer Web average response changed from 601.09 ms to 634.97 ms: WORSENED.
- Primary Explorer API average response changed from 447.39 ms to 477.39 ms: WORSENED.
- The later observation window shows weaker overall infrastructure availability.

## 6. Status & Response-Class Glossary

| Status / Class | Meaning |
|---|---|
| HEALTHY | The endpoint or overall infrastructure state is reachable and behaving as expected. |
| DEGRADED | The endpoint is reachable, but one or more checks or response-time indicators show reduced quality. |
| PARTIAL_OUTAGE | At least one monitored endpoint is unavailable or failing while other endpoints remain reachable. |
| UNHEALTHY | The endpoint failed required checks or did not provide usable responses. |
| FAST | The observed response-time class is fast for this watcher context. |
| MODERATE | The observed response-time class is acceptable but not fast. |
| SLOW | The observed response-time class is slow and may indicate degraded user experience. |
| UNKNOWN | The watcher could not classify the response-time state, often because older snapshots did not include this field. |
| N/A | Not available or not applicable for the selected observation, endpoint, or historical snapshot. |

## 7. Interpretation Guide

- Window A represents the earlier observation segment.
- Window B represents the later observation segment.
- For availability score, higher is better.
- For response time, lower is better.
- Older snapshots may show N/A or UNKNOWN response classes because response-time classification was added after the initial watcher release.
- This comparison report is independent observation material and not an official DAC service status page.
